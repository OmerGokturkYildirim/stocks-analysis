I add DoEvent to my code so millions of data can be analyzed, the computer does not freeze. Also, instead of using ticker(i), I use a real ticker name for the macro. So I do not need any change in my code if I have new tickers. When the macro is worked, automatically, it defines new tickers and their total daily volume and returns. Also, this macro can be used for previous years or next years too.

Analyzing Data
When I analyze the data, there are some significant increases in some companies, but next year most of them have a decrease. Only two companies have a stable increase for 2017 and 2018 ENPH and RUN.
When we look at the data for 2018, it can be said that there is a crisis in this sector. Probably two companies know how to handle this case, ENPH, and RUN.

We can focus on these two companies. Although RUN had a great increase in 2018, it had a slight increase in 2017. ENPH has a great increase in 2017 and 2018.

What is my advice for this man is
He can divide his total money into four pieces. 
2/4 of the money can be invested in ENPH because this company has a great increase in return. Also, we can see an increase in people's demand for this company.

1/4 of the money can be invested in RUN, they had a great increase in 2018, but they did not have that much increase in 2017. They took advantage of managing crises very well, but if the market comes back again, we can not be sure that they will have the same success still.

1/4 of the money can be invested in SEDG. This company had the second-best increase in 2017, and it lost only %7.8 in 2018. Although %7.8 loss people's demand increased in 2018, it shows that people believe in this company. If the crisis passes, this company can have a great increase again, like 2017. Probably, they do not know how to manage the crisis.

DQ, HASI, TERP, and VSLR has an increase in their volume but DQ and HASI great loss in 2018. TERP and VSLR had a small amount of loss, but these two companies did not have so much increase in 2017. That's why I eliminate these four companies.
2/4 for ENPH
1/4 for RUN
1/4 SEDG
